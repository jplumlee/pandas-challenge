# Observations

1.	Across the board each gender spends roughly the same amount even though the number of transactions per gender varies drastically. Males make up most of the purchases and the overall purchase value.

2.	More than half the buyers are between the ages of 15-24 (63.37%) with a sharp decline after the age of 25.

3.	There are three items, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, Fiery Glass Crusader, and Nirvana that are in both the most profitable and most popular. The price for the three items is also within $0.67 of each other with Oathbreaker being the least expensive but most profitable and popular of the three.
